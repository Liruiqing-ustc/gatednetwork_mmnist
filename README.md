Repository for the code used in my M.Sc. thesis "Gating Networks in Learning Machines for Multimodality"

To run the two- and three-modality experiments, the training and the validation data can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DveKyNjM_HEly-HeCC8r4nGyhAHPXzPT?usp=sharing

It contains the softmax prediction of all SMCs.
